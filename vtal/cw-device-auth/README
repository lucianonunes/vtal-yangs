# Summary
This is a generated NSO function pack in Python.
It contains a YANG model which implements the following:
1. A secure store for device credentials in NCS operational database.
2. Actions to manage the credentials.

# Details
Crosswork Change Automation device authorization module provides action endpoints
to manage user provided device credentials while executing a playbook job in Change Automation.
The intent is to use these user provided credentials at runtime instead of the device credentials
defined in any device authgroup. This will be achieved by configuring a special user in NSO
with a umap that can invoke the credential retrieval action below to get these user provided
device credentials.
